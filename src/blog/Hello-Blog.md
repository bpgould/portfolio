## Hello, Blog!

#### Introduction

**All opinions expressed within this blog and website are my own and in no way represent the opinions of my employer.**
<br/>

Now that you have sufficiently cringed, welcome to my blog. Over the years, I have had many eclectic passions, hobbies, and 2-week-deep-dives. A few spouts even yielded one-off blog posts landing on one of the roughly 25 domains that I have recklessly collected since I learned how to purchase one. Seeing that I have roughly 25 domains on auto-renew should serve as adequate evidence as to why I will not be sharing any personal finance advise. So, what will I be writing about?
<br/>

- Computer Science & Software Development
- Microservice Architecture & Design
- DevOps, CloudOps, & Site Reliability Engineering
- High Performance Computing, Distributed Systems Design, & Linux
- Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, & GPU Programming
- Cybersecurity & DevSecOps
- I.T. Administration & Computer Networking
- Certifications (CompTIA, AWS, Azure, GCP, & More)
- Applied Mathematics
- High School, College, & Career Advise
- Maker Projects, Marathon Running, & Miscellaneous
  <br/>

That's a long list and there is enough information within those subject areas to fill 100 lifetimes of learning. Consequently, I admit that I am not a expert in even one of those fields, however, I have positioned myself professionally in way that I provide value by knowing a decent little chunk of all of them.

#### Boring Obligatory Background Information

Whoami? If you got the joke, you are definitely within the target audience for this blog. If not then you probably never worked as a Windows admin and that is okay too.
<br/>

The standard remarks: I was a systems administrator for 3 years (4 years total in IT), studied applied math & CS at Wake Forest University, did a 6 month full stack web development bootcamp at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, worked in a biochemistry lab doing molecular dynamics research, and another lab working on machine learning workflow infrastructure automation (not ML itself).
<br/>

The more interesting answer: I enjoy building wood furniture - often with some electronics integrated, running absurd distances for no good reason (marathons for now, maybe a 50k in the future), making infographics in draw.io, and long comma separated lists. I find social commentary to be my favorite genre of comedy and I may comment on current events from time to time, but I will refrain from anything overtly political. I also have a failed YouTube channel that I may revive at some point if I find someone to do the editing. 
<br/>

Finally, I love teaching and helping people. I have been known to help others finish interesting challenge problems for their calc 3 extra credit before finishing my own homework. I believe that higher education, especially private, is largely a business for profit and political influence and consequently my approach to learning has been less traditional than most. I am **_always_** happy to answer career questions and help people who are interested in working in the tech field. The world rewards people who have the courage to ask for help and I like to make myself a part of that idea by always being available (preferably on LinkedIn).

#### Fun Facts

- My favorite programming languages are Julia, C++, and Java (in that order)
<br/>

I plan to do a full series on Julia (using python packages, calling Fortran libraries, data visualization, Flux.jl, etc.)

- I have a startup that is working on some cool big data video ML drone stuff, but really it is just a glorified team personal project that we use to learn technologies that require scale
- I do not believe in portrait-oriented monitors for programming, however, I do believe that dark mode is superior and necessary
- I love writing documents and study guides in LaTeX - however, I have yet to meet someone who is competent at TikZ and if you are I would love to know how you learned
- I started, but have not finished a book on integration (calculus) techniques - I find integration problems to be a fun challenge where you can easily lump in lots of mathematical concepts
- Greyhounds are my favorite breed of dog and I plan on getting another one when my schedule allows me to take care of a dog
